cmd
  cargo update/build
  cargo shuttle run/deploy
  cargo shuttle project restart --idle-minutes 0

delta
  to: demoable bots
  - 
  from: basic editable bots
  =
  step: multi-msg prompt channels

  default to gpt4 for it's system prompt power
  
  though i want to chop bot responses by 1000 instead of 2000
  "stream" in the chat completion
  so i can send out the first part sooner in a longer response
  
  tune and adapt models
